"""
sunnyconf.server — stdlib HTTP API for the config daemon.

Chosen stack: http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer (Python standard library). Rationale (see
INVESTIGATION.md): the on-device updater never runs pip/uv, so a new third-party dep would not reach
the car; the stdlib is guaranteed present. The surface is tiny (a handful of endpoints) and the
synchronous handler pairs naturally with the synchronous Params() API.

Auth: every endpoint except /health and /pair requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (see auth.py).
Pair once with the PIN shown on the comma screen; the client then holds a long-lived token.

Endpoints:
  GET  /health                 -> {"ok": true}                       (open)
  POST /pair  {pin,client_id,label} -> {token, ...} | 401 bad_pin    (open; proves physical access)
  GET  /status                 -> {onroad, offroad, model, dongle_id, schema_version, ...}
  GET  /schema[?refresh=1][&all=1]  -> the settings schema (the client renders the menu from this)
  GET  /values[?all=1]         -> {key: "<current value>"} for every key in the schema
  GET  /params/<key>           -> {key, value, meta}
  PUT  /params/<key>  {"value"}-> validate + write; 409 if offroad_only and onroad; 403 if blocked
  DELETE /params/<key>         -> remove an allowlisted EXTRA_KEYS param (the OSM flows need remove semantics)
  GET  /maps                   -> Maps/OSM page state: mapd version, size, download progress, selection
  GET  /maps/check             -> is the map-data server newer than our download? {update_available, ...}
  GET  /mirror                 -> UI mirror (screen cast) state: {installed, enabled, streaming, port}
                                  (on/off itself is PUT /params/UiMirrorEnabled; the video is NOT proxied
                                  here — the client streams it straight off the add-on's own port)
  GET  /drives                 -> recorded routes (watcher-indexer runs continuously) + indexing progress
  GET  /drives/live            -> is a drive recording right now + started/elapsed/distance so far
  GET  /drives/<route>/track   -> merged GPS points + engagement bar + event markers (app-ready)
  GET  /drives/<route>/thumb/<seg>     -> per-minute road JPEG (filmstrip)
  GET  /drives/<route>/playlist.m3u8   -> HLS playlist of the route's qcamera segments (+ /qcam/<seg>.ts)
  DELETE /drives/<route>       -> delete a drive's recordings + cache (409 while it's being recorded)
  PUT  /maps  {"countries"}    -> set the (multi-)country map selection [{"ref","title"},...]
  DELETE /maps/<ref>           -> remove ONE country from the selection + delete its tiles (geometry-aware)
  POST /actions/<name>         -> device actions (reboot, ..., delete_maps, osm_update)
  GET  /clients                -> [{client_id, label, paired_at}]    (manage paired devices)
  DELETE /clients/<client_id>  -> {ok, removed} (un-pair a device)
